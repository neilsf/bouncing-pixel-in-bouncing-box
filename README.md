# bouncing-pixel-in-bouncing-box
XC=BASIC solution of the Bouncing Pixel in Bouncing Box challenge proposed by Eyvind Ebsen [in his post in the Commodore 64/128 Programming Facebook group](https://www.facebook.com/share/v/1KKM5RVwS7/).
This implementation is not aiming to optimize for small size (it is 1952 bytes compiled) but demonstrates a good balance between readability and performance. The graphics is animated at 50/60 FPS, depending on PAL or NTSC system.
## How to compile
A compiled .prg file is already available in this repository but if you want to compile the source for yourself, please go to the [XC=BASIC documentation](https://xc-basic.net/doku.php?id=v3:start) site for instructions on how to install and use XC=BASIC.
